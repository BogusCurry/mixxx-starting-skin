# Mixxx Starting Skin
A starting skin for [Mixxx DJ 2.0](http://www.mixxx.org) - clone this repo to start your own and make a new skin easily.

This skin is a very simple skin, flexible, with a minimum of controls, but easy to understand if you want to start your own Skin for this fantastic DJ program. 


## How to start skining
1. Clone this repo and put it into the skins folder of Mixxx. You can find help [here](http://www.mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=2432).
2. Use your favorite text editor to edit : **skin.xml**. In this file, you will find all information about visuals, buttons, sliders, etc.
3. To view your changes, just to another skin in the settings and come back to your one. It's already working!


## Tips and Tricks

* To start skining, read the file tutorial.md so you can really discover how skining is done in Mixxx. As it's infinite, start as I did : one thing after another :-)
* Comment your work! It's so nice to have a commented skin, so others can understand what you did.

I asked some help on forums, and I finnaly decided to start my own starting theme and share with others. 

Don't hesitate to ask me questions... But as I'm no coder, it's better if you ask directly on [Mixxx's Forums](http://www.mixxx.org/forums/index.php).
